# Computer Interface

Computer Interface is a library for Gorilla Tag which replaces the base computer with a custom computer, and allows developers to add functionality to it.

## Install

The recommended way to install Computer Interface is through [MonkeModManager](https://github.com/arielthemonke/MonkeModManager/releases/latest). Simply select Computer Interface from the menu, and hit "Install".
This will ensure you have all the necessary things to use Computer Interface.

## CommandLine

Computer Interface ships with a CLI that enables you to execute routines & change settings.

Information on creating commands can be found in the [Adding Your Own Commands](#adding-your-own-commands) section.

By default Computer Interface ships with the following commands:

- **setcolor** ``int`` ``int`` ``int``  
  Changes your gorilla's color (e.g. setcolor 255 255 255)
- **setname** ``string``  
  Changes your gorilla's name (e.g. setname toni)
- **join** ``string``  
  Connects to a room code (e.g. join dev123)
- **leave**  
  Disconnects you from the current room
- **cam** ``string``  
  Changes your spectator camera's perspective to either First Person (fp) or Third Person (tp)
- **setbg** ``int`` ``int`` ``int``  
  Changes your computer's background color (e.g. setbg 40 70 40)
- **resetbg**  
  Resets the computer's background.

## Background

To use a custom background image:

- Go to your Gorilla Tag folder, and open ``BepInEx/config/tonimacaroni.computerinterface.cfg``.
- Find the `ScreenBackgroundPath` config option, and replace the path with your own image path.
  - Use forward slashes (/) instead of backslashes (\\) in the path
  - Your background will be multiplied by the background's color
  - Paths can either be relative to your Gorilla Tag folder or absolute.

As of Computer Interface version 1.9.0, using the `resetbg` makes it easier to change you background without the need to restart your game.  
You can also run ``setbg 255 255 255`` to leave the background with no modified color.

## Additional Features

- Command Line
- Ability to toggle supported mods on and off
- Animated keys
- Custom background (Image & Color)

## For Developers

Before you begin reading I have created a very well-documented example mod which you can use as a starting point.  
It shows examples for creating multiple views, navigating between those and creating your own commands:

For more advanced examples check out the base library views here:

### Adding Views

Computer Interface works with "Views" which are classes that inherit from `ComputerView` or `IComputerView`.

Views can navigate to others views through `ShowView<TargetView>()`, or return to the main menu with `ReturnToMainMenu()`.  
Views can check for key presses by overriding `OnKeyPressed`.

An example view may look like this:

```csharp
public class ExampleView : ComputerView {
    // Called when the view is opened by the user.
    public override void OnShow(object[] args) {
        base.OnShow(args);
        
        // A 'Redraw' method is usually made for easier reading.
        Redraw();
    }
    
    // The method that usually handles the text on the screen.
    private void Redraw() {
        // A StringBuilder is usually made for easy text making.
        var stringBuilder = new StringBuilder();
        
        // Uses the top of the screen to showoff what tab you are currently on.
        stringBuilder.BeginCenter().Repeat("=", SCREEN_WIDTH).AppendLine();
        stringBuilder.Append("Example Tab").AppendLine();
        stringBuilder.Repeat("=", SCREEN_WIDTH).EndAlign().AppendLines(2);
        
        // Makes text below the "titlebar".
        stringBuilder.AppendLine("Computer Interface Example!");
        
        Text = stringBuilder.ToString();
    }

    // When a key on the keyboard is pressed, the key pressed is sent back as a parameter to be used.
    public override void OnKeyPressed(EKeyboardKey key) {
        switch (key) {
            case EKeyboardKey.Back:
                // 'ReturnToMainMenu();' is used to return to the MainMenuView.
                // 'ShowView<ViewToShow>();' can be used to switch to another view.
                ReturnToMainMenu();
                break;
            case EKeyboardKey.Option1:
                // 'ShowView<TargetView>();' can be used to switch to another view.
                ShowView<ExampleHelpView>();
                break;
        }
    }
}
```

To add a view to the main menu, you need to create a Mod Entry, and Computer Interface will automatically detect it on launch.  
Mod Entries must implement `IComputerModEntry`, and provide the name type of the view to be shown.

For example:

```csharp
// A selectable entry on the MainMenuView.
// Entries are automatically detected by ComputerInterface.
public class ExampleViewEntry : IComputerModEntry {
    // The name of the entry that will be shown.
    public string EntryName => "Example";
    
    // The first view that the user is going to see when selecting your entry.
    public Type EntryViewType => typeof(ExampleView);
}
```

### Adding Your Own Commands

Adding your own CLI commands is easy - create a class that inherits `ICommandRegistrar`, and Computer Interface will automatically detect it on launch.

For example:

```csharp
public class ExampleCommandManager : ICommandRegistrar {
    private CommandHandler _commandHandler;
    
    public void Initialize() {
        // Request the CommandHandler.
        _commandHandler = CommandHandler.Singleton;

        RegisterCommands();
    }

    public void RegisterCommands() {
        // Register your commands.
        
        // You can set 'argumentTypes' to null if you aren't going to have any.
        _commandHandler.AddCommand(new Command(name: "monke", argumentTypes: null, arguments => {
            // Arguments are an array of strings passed when entering the command.
            // The CommandHandler already checks if the correct amount of arguments is passed.
            
            // The string you return is going to be shown in the terminal as a return message.
            // You can break up the message into multiple lines by using '\n'
            return "MONKE";
        }));
    }
}
```

This used a dummy class `ExampleCommandManager`, but of course, you can do this in any type as long as you request the `CommandHandler`.
